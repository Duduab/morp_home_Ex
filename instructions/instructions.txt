build an animals app
1. the app will consist of:
    * top bar - will iclude:
        title
        total animals counter
        "add new animal" button
    * lists section - will iclude:
        4 lists (animal type, animal color, animal weight, animal length) as described next:
            each list will have:
                * title and counter of number of items in this list
                * list with the items of the relevant category (type / color / wight / length) (each list should be scrollable if there more items then can fit)
                * unique feature of those lists: clicking on any element of the one of the lists will highlights the coresponding items in the other lists for example:
                    click on "cat" in the "type" list will trigger the other lists: 
                        in "color" list all the colors items that have type cat will be hilighted
                        in "weight" list all the weights items that have type cat will be hilighted
                        in "length" list all the lenghts items that have type cat will be hilighted
                    each click will re trigger the relevant items


you are provided with a base (clean) angular app (angluar 10)
inside you have the front end section (src directory) and a backend section (backend directory)
the backend is only for you to get the data from the api call (do not change it)

you need to have node 12+ installed (download and install from https://nodejs.org/en/)

run "npm install" to install all the dependencies for this project.
run "ng serve" to run the angular app (the app will run on localhost:4200)
to run the backend simply run the command "npm run start-server" from the cmd (when you are in the application's directory) - the server will run on this address http://localhost:3000

the API that you are provided are:
    GET request: /getAnimalsList (http://localhost:3000/getAnimalsList)
    this api will return a list similar to this:
    [
        {
            "type": "cat",
            "color": "white",
            "weight": 10,
            "length": 20
        },
        {
            "type": "dog",
            "color": "black",
            "weight": 15,
            "length": 25
        }
        ...
    ]
